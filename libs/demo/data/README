The demo comes with 2 "database" files: num.db and contact.db.
They are text files: you can view them:
One is a list of numbers, the other a list of contacts with names and e-mails.

The demo allows to query those two files in SQL: queries are very simple
(no joins, no aggregate functions):
you can have a look at queries.num or queries.contact, they contain query
examples.

To run the demo:

java ZDemo

then send queries like "select * from num;", etc...

You can also run the demo with the sample queries:
java ZDemo queries.num
 or
java ZDemo queries.contact

Of course, the demo sources are available: see ZDemo.java for more info.

Have fun,
